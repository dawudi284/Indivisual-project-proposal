## Abstract
This project will be bases on point of sale system. A fairly known project, but I think it can be improved in many ways so it will be a great start as a project. Always wanted to work on a similar project so this is a great opportunity. It is a vert basic project but I think the class can come up with complex ways to approach this project.

### Project Relevance
The real life application of this project makes it very relevant. Furthermore, It can help in polishing the skills and ideas we have to approach this in a more interesting way. Many of the topics we have learnt in the class relate to this project like Object Oriented Design, user interface, test driven development can all be used for this project.

#### Conceptual Design

A Java Bases Application

Based on the Item purchased by Customer, the Operator can select that item from the Item list displayed on the Terminal screen
For each Customer, the system will keep record of all items per transaction and finally persist the transaction information to external file for future use. Display Total sell amount at any point of time. After authorized Operator starts the system, she will be displayed with all available Item Numbers and Description. Based on the Items presented by Customer, the Operator will record each item to the system. System will record each transaction which should contains following information (TransactionId, Date[ddmmyyyy], Time[HH:min:sec], OperatorId, MachineId, CustomerId,  ItemId, ItemPriceAmount).
